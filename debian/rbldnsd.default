# /etc/default/rbldnsd
# This file should set one variable, RBLDNSD, to be a multiline
# list of all instances of rbldnsd to start.  Every line in that
# list consist of a key (basename for a pid file), and rbldnsd
# command line, e.g.:
#
# RBLDNSD="dsbl -r/var/lib/rbldns/dsbl -b127.2 list.dsbl.org:ip4set:list"
#
# or, using multiple lines and line continuations:
#
# RBLDNSD="dsbl -r/var/lib/rbldns/dsbl -b 127.2 \
#   list.dsbl.org:ip4set:list \
#   multihop.dsbl.org:ip4set:multihop \
#   unconfirmed.dsbl.org:ip4set:unconfirmed \
#
# local -r/var/lib/rbldns/local -b 127.3 \
#   dialups.bl.example.com:ip4set:dialups \
#   spews.bl.example.com:ip4set:spews \
#   inputs.bl.example.com:ip4set:inputs \
#   bl.example.com:ip4set:dialups \
#   bl.example.com:ip4set:spews \
#   bl.example.com:ip4set:inputs \
#

#
# This is the recommended way to keep entries readable and
# easily editable.
#
# the first word, key, will be used to form pid file name, like
# /var/run/rbldnsd-dsbl.pid, /var/run/rbldnsd-local.pid etc.
# So, all keys should be unique.  This is done in order to support
# several instances of rbldnsd, if that'll be required.  In a
# simple case, when only one instance is needed, key may be
# specified as a single dash, -, and in this case pid file
# will be /var/run/rbldnsd.pid :
#
# RBLDNSD="- -r/var/lib/rbldns -b127.2 \
#   zone list...\
# "
#
# See rbldnsd(8) for descriptions of options.
